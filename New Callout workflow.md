Creating a new callout is very easy using QuickAdd.

First position your text cursor in the note where you want to create a callout. Then:

- Press ctrl/cmd+P to open the Command Palette.
- Type "quick" and select "Run QuickAdd".
- Select "New Callout"
- Configure your callout, and press submit. That should create something that looks like this, but with your own options:

> [!note]- A callout
> Hello!

Here's what that looks like in practice:

## Available Options
I have configured the callout modal to ask for type (with a handy select list, so you don't have to remember the options), title, contents, and it allows you to create a collapsible callout if you desire.

You can add or remove options if you like, by editing the form. Do this by opening the Command Palette and searching for "edit form".
