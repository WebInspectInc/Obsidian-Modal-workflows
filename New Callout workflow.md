Creating a new callout is very easy using QuickAdd.

First position your text cursor in the note where you want to create a callout. Then:

Press ctrl/cmd+P to open the Command Palette. type "quick" and select "Run QuickAdd". Select "New Callout", configure your callout, and press submit. That should create something that looks like this, but with your own options:

> [!note]- A callout
> Hello!
